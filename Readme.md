# Project Setup Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project. Follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth configuration and deployment process.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following tools installed and configured:

### Terraform

Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### AWS CLI

Install the AWS Command Line Interface to interact with AWS services from your terminal. Download it from the [AWS CLI website](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

### AWS Account

Sign up for an AWS account if you donâ€™t already have one. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and IAM resources.

### MongoDB Cluster URI

Set up a MongoDB cluster (e.g., using MongoDB Atlas) and obtain the connection URI.

## Setting Up Remote S3 Backend for Terraform

To store your Terraform state remotely and enable state locking, follow these steps:

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket

- Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to the S3 service.
- Create a new bucket with a unique name (e.g., `my-terraform-state-bucket`).
- Configure the bucket to enable versioning (recommended for state management).

### 2. Create a DynamoDB Table

- Navigate to the DynamoDB service in the AWS Management Console.
- Create a new table:
    - **Table Name**: `terraform-lock-table`
    - **Primary Key**: `LockID` (String)

### 3. Configure Terraform Backend

Update the `terraform.tf` file in the `terraform_template` folder with the following configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
    required_providers {
        aws = {
            source  = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "5.80.0"
        }
    }

    backend "s3" {
        bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
        key            = "{{BACKEND_KEY}}"  
        region         = "us-east-1"
        dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
        encrypt        = true
    }
}
```

This configuration ensures that:

- Your Terraform state is securely stored in the S3 bucket.
- DynamoDB handles state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Set Up AWS Credentials

- Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
- Create a new user with programmatic access.
- Attach the necessary policies (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `DynamoDBFullAccess`, `AdministratorAccess`).
- Download the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the user.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. Add the following variables to the `.env` file or copy paste from `.env.save` file:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
DB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
ENVIRONMENT=development
DEFAULT_SENDER=yourEmail@example.com
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN=yourGeneratedJwtAccessToken
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN=yourGeneratedJwtRefreshToken
OPENAI_API_KEY=yourOpenAiKey
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to set up the project:

```sh
nvm use                # Use the correct Node.js version
npm install            # Install project dependencies
npm run husky          # Set up Git hooks (if applicable)
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:4000] or the port specified in your configuration.
